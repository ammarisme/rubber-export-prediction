Each variable has a significance level. Coefficient significance level.

The root mean square error, which shows the accuracy of the demand equation,
was calculated as 0.09. The R-square value was calculated
as 0.54, which showed the goodness of fit of the demand
model. This demand model was significant at t

This supply model was
significant at the 5 percent level.

Explanatory Variables Forecast
e automotive business, especially in tires, so
automotive business sluggishness results in only a slight
increase in natural rubber demand on the world market
